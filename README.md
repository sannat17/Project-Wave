# Project-Wave
Research: Fourier Series and application in Machine Learning for feature extraction from waves (sound and image).

## Structure:

### Research_Fourier_Series folder
Contains all the research I've done in using Fourier Series to extract features from waves by conversion to frequency domain and doing interesting manipulations in that domain to reduce number of input features required for Machine Learning.
